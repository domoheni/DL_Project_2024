The current repository contains three folders with the models we work with:

ViT: Contains the Vision Transformer (ViT) model with a base configuration of 16x16.
DIRE: Contains the Diffusion-Generated Image Recognition (DIRE) model.
CNN: Contains a custom CNN model that we created.
Additionally, the ImageAnalysis.ipynb notebook contains the script used for image analysis.
