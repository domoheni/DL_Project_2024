# DL_Project_2024

This repository constains the files built for the project of Deep Learning course 02456, ocurring on fall 2024. These were constructed and worked on by Henrietta, Afonso, Marco and George.

## Context

Recent advances in synthetic image generation have set a new standard due to their remarkable ability to produce high-quality images. While users benefit from the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, concerns
about potential privacy issues have emerged. There is an increasingly alarming possibility that attackers could exploit diffusion models to develop advanced deepfake techniques.
Consequently, there is a pressing need for effective detectors
to identify diffusion-generated images.


To address this challenge and contribute to safer and more
trustworthy digital spaces, an investigation was conducted
into a diverse set of classifiers and generators. This study
aimed to uncover insights into their unique characteristics,
limitations, and potential areas for future improvement.


## Repository Structure
The current repository contains three folders with the models we work with:

- ViT
    - Contains the Vision Transformer (ViT) model with a base configuration of 16x16.
- DIRE 
    - Contains the Diffusion-Generated Image Recognition (DIRE) model.
- CNN
    - Contains a custom CNN model that we created.


The Fine-Tuning folder contains all the files related to the investigation done regarding this topic. Additionally, the ImageAnalysis.ipynb notebook contains the script used for image analysis. More information can be found inside each folder.
